# Electricity Theft Detection System Using ESP32
This project is an innovative approach to detect electricity theft using an ESP32 microcontroller. It measures the electric current using a current sensor, analyzes the data for irregularities, and sends the information to a server for further analysis. The system aims to prevent electricity theft and ensure efficient energy distribution.

# Features
1.Real-time current monitoring using a current sensor. 

2.Transmission of data to a server via Wi-Fi for analysis.

3.Detection of anomalies that may indicate electricity theft.

4.Easy integration with IoT systems for remote monitoring and control.
# Components
1.ESP32 Development Board – Core microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities.

2.ACS712/ACS758 Current Sensor – Measures the electric current in real time.

3.Wi-Fi Network – For data transmission to a server.

4.Power Supply – Powers the ESP32 and sensor.
Optional Components – LEDs or display for visual feedback.
# How It Works
1.Current Measurement: The current sensor 

2.continuously monitors the load current.

3.Data Processing: The ESP32 processes the readings and formats the data.

4.Transmission: Processed data is sent to a server over a Wi-Fi network.

5.Analysis: The server analyzes the data for irregularities or patterns indicating potential theft.

6.Alerts: Notifications or logs are generated if anomalies are detected.
# Applications
1.Monitoring electricity usage in residential, commercial, and industrial settings.

2.Detecting and preventing unauthorized electricity consumption.

3.Enhancing the efficiency of power distribution networks.
# Future Scope
1.Implementation of machine learning for advanced anomaly detection.

2.Integration with cloud-based dashboards for detailed analytics and real-time visualization.

3.Expansion to include voltage and power factor monitoring for comprehensive energy audits.
